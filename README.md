# Playground-Kaggle-PredictingHeartDisease
This is my first attempt on Kaggle Playground. I used the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle to determine the probability of having Heart Disease based on predictors. 
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on a number of predictors. It follows a standard supervised learning pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

The dataset contains medical attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Blood pressure (BP)

Cholesterol

Fasting blood sugar

ECG results

Maximum heart rate

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression

Number of vessels

Thallium test result

Target Variable (Heart Disease)

Presence → 1

Absence → 0
