# Playground-Kaggle-PredictingHeartDisease
This is my first attempt on Kaggle Playground. I used the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle to determine the probability of having Heart Disease based on predictors. 
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on a number of predictors. It follows a standard supervised learning pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

The dataset contains medical attributes such as:

Id

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

BP

Cholesterol

FBS over 120

EKG results

Max HR

Exercise angina

ST depression

Slope od ST

Number of vessels fluro

Thallium 

Target Variable (Heart Disease)

Presence → 1

Absence → 0
